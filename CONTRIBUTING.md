> **This guide serves to set clear expectations for everyone involved with the project so that we can improve it together while also creating a welcoming space for everyone to participate. Following these guidelines will help ensure a positive experience for contributors and maintainers.**

## Asking Questions

GitHub issues are not the appropriate place to debug your specific project, but should be reserved for filing bugs and feature requests.

## Opening an Issue

Before creating an issue, check if you are using the latest version of the project. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

### Reporting Security Issues

**Do not** file a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

### Bug Reports and Other Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report. Be clear, concise, and descriptive. Provide as much information as you can, including steps to reproduce the issue, stack traces, compiler errors, library versions, OS versions, and screenshots (if applicable). Put code blocks and console outputs in backticks (```). This improves readability.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted. We want to avoid [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep). Your idea may be great, but also out-of-scope for the project. If accepted, we cannot make any commitments regarding the timeline for implementation and release. However, you are welcome to submit a pull request to help!

## Code Review

- **Review the code, not the author.** Look for and suggest improvements without disparaging or insulting the author. Provide actionable feedback and explain your reasoning.

- **You are not your code.** When your code is critiqued, questioned, or constructively criticized, remember that you are not your code. Do not take code review personally.

- **Always do your best.** No one writes bugs on purpose. Do your best, and learn from your mistakes.

- Kindly note any violations to the guidelines specified in this document. 

## Coding Style

Consistency is the most important. Following the existing style, formatting, and naming conventions of the file you are modifying and of the overall project. Failure to do so will result in a prolonged review process that has to focus on updating the superficial aspects of your code, rather than improving its functionality and performance.

For example, if all private properties are prefixed with an underscore `_`, then new ones you add should be prefixed in the same way. Or, if methods are named using camelcase, like `thisIsMyNewMethod`, then do not diverge from that by writing `this_is_my_new_method`. You get the idea. If in doubt, please ask or search the codebase for something similar.
